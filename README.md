## üöÄ Key Features

### AI-Powered Smart Assistant (New in v2.0)
* **üß† Natural Language Queries:** Interact with your inventory using plain Turkish. Ask complex questions like *"Stoƒüu 5'ten az olan y√ºz√ºkler hangileri?"* (Which rings have less than 5 in stock?) or *"Ge√ßen ayki karƒ±m ne kadardƒ±?"* (What was my profit last month?).
* **ü§ñ Local & Private:** Powered by Ollama, the assistant runs 100% locally on your machine. Your data never leaves your computer.
* **‚öôÔ∏è Tool-Using Agent:** The LLM uses a set of defined "tools" to query the database, ensuring accurate and structured answers based on your real data.

### UI & User Experience
* **Central Dashboard:** A modern welcome screen provides quick access to all major functions.
* **Single-Window Architecture:** All modules are presented as "pages" with smooth, animated slide transitions inside a single main window.
* **Easy Navigation:** A "Back" button allows for intuitive navigation from sub-pages back to the dashboard.

### Inventory & Reporting
* **Advanced Product Management:** Full CRUD, multi-select for bulk delete, and "Export to Excel" functionality.
* **Conditional Formatting:** The inventory table automatically highlights low-stock items in orange and out-of-stock items in red.
* **Detailed Sales Statistics:** A dedicated report tab calculates and displays Total Sales, Cost of Goods Sold, and Net Profit/Loss for any selected date range.
* **Interactive Daily Drill-Down:** The calendar in the report section is interactive. Clicking a day opens a detailed list of all transactions for that specific day.
