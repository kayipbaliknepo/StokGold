StokGold is a modern desktop inventory management application for jewelers. This version introduces an **experimental** AI-powered Smart Assistant using LangChain and the Groq API for natural language queries.

**Current Status:** The AI Assistant feature is a work-in-progress and currently has known stability issues. The agent can correctly select tools but may enter into loops or fail to return a final answer. This version is committed for backup and further debugging purposes.
